Fun Project: Encrypt ... to Chinese - by Meng Zhang
------

### Notes:
This is just a fun project I created for personal use. It encrypts English plaintext to Chinese Ciphertext.
This encryption cannot increase security by any means. In fact, I designed it in such way that any people with basic knowledge of English, Chinese, and Computer Science/Encryption should be able to decrypt it. It was originally designed to fool a dating site censorship:)
